# hidden-morse-code
I have hidden morse code in an image  
Look at the "easy to see morse.png"  
The black pixels are what make up the letters. Each black pixel is a "dit". Three dit's make a "dah". Three white spaces is a space between two letters. Seven white spaces is a space between two words.  

The "morse.png" is exactly the same, except all the white is RGB (1,1,1), and all the black pixels are RGB (0,0,0)

Use "morse writer.py" to create an image with hidden morse in it.  
Use "morse reader.py" to read the hidden morse.
